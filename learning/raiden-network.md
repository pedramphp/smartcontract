raiden is inspired by the Lightning Network.


POW: Number of transactions 17 per second - super low for the grand vision.
Raiden Network to make fast transactions.

All blocks needs to be mined before the transactions are confirmed.

Do all micro transactions between several parties on the blockchain.



State channel - all transactions on the state channel - each transaction is signed by the sender.
when the state the channel is closed then it gets broadcasted to the blockchain.
Micro transactoins.

two way discussion channel between users.
participants sign each message of transactions.
Cheap and very fast to execute.

Raiden Node - runs in parallel to ethereum node.
only results will get stored in the main chain.

Micro Transactions.

Decentralized M2M markets. machines can sell chunks of bandwidth, storage and cpu time, energy, sensor data, etc. can be traded.

API Access.
Fast Decentralized networks
