Blockchain.
Decentralized data structure that stores data in particular format.
Exists in a peer to peer network, distributed or a decentralized network.

Data will exist in multiple computers in the same time.
all operations on the Data structure will happen in the peer to peer network.

It's like book that each page have a reference to the previous page.
Easy to detect if a page has removed.
easy to detect if there is any deletion.

What if the content of the page has been altered?
Produce the page number by crunching the content of the page.

Each block is built on top of the previous block.

Everyone in the network has access to the entire copy of the blockchain.

Minor task: compile transactions into the block and add blocks to the blockchain.

In Public blockchain it is made computationally difficult to add a bock to prevent attacks.

Miners received rewards to solve the computational power.
Adding a block to blockchain to difficult


Private minors can chose other methods to add a block as they can trust the miners using a contract.

Decentralized distributed ledger (data structure)
data is being stored inside of blocks in form of transactions.
removes the dependency on trusted third party for recording the data in blocks.
In public blockchain more complex algorithm require to avoid malicious activities,

Since each block is built on top of previous bock immutability has been achieved.
very difficult to fake a block & very easy to detect the fake block.

All in memory of the computers.

Every participant in the blockchain receives almost the same.

Ethereum:
Open source blockchain-based distributed computing applications platform mainly used to build and implement smart contracts.

Ethereum 30 July 2015 launched.
Ether as a virtual currency
